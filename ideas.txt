-The crawler should have a space to ask the user or admin something it is unsure of.
It can ask "What is this Activist's cause?" implying knowlege that every activist is a person
(instead of asking "What is this Person's cause?")

-Can an intellegent crawler discern the subject type of information on its own?
an example:
	The crawler comes across the word arsonist. After following proceedure and searching for relevent info 
	on google, wikipedia etc... it comes uses context to conclude that an arsonist is a person. It would then
	need to further categorize an arsonist as a criminal. Person > Criminal > Arsonist
